# Generative AI (Gen AI) Training

## Description

Generative AI (Gen AI), most famously represented by ChatGPT, is leading the next technological revolution. In this training, we embark on a journey to demystify this remarkable technology and unlock its transformative potential.

Imagine a virtual assistant capable of:
- Enhancing data exploration and analysis
- Comprehending and generating human-like text from data
- Generating code in SAS, R, and Python
- Converting code between SAS, R, and Python
- Answering questions based on specific datasets
- Visualizing data for deeper insights
- Assisting in content creation such as research reports
- Supporting literature reviews

To truly harness the power of Gen AI, itâ€™s essential to learn the art of **prompt engineering**, **application development using Gen AI APIs**, and **fine-tuning Gen AI with your own data**.  
This training will equip you with the knowledge, skills, and ethical practices needed to effectively use Gen AI in your work and projects.
